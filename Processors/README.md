| DisablePkgRef       | Sets the `active` flag to false for a given `<PkgRef>` tag inside a distribution XML file. This is useful when you want to only select a specific set of component packages to be used during installation. |
| PkgSigner           | Signs a PKG using the built-in macOS `productsign` command.                                                                                                                                                 |
| ComponentPkgWrapper | Uses the built-in macOS `productbuild` command to "wrap" a component package into a distribution package. This process optionally lets you sign the new distribution package as well.                       |
